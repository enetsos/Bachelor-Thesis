# Mobile app for clocking management and quality control of collaborators

This diploma project, presented as part of the Bachelor in Computer Engineering course at
the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI), focuses on
the development of a mobile application for time tracking and quality control of collaborators.
The project was carried out to meet the needs of Progect SA, a company active in cleaning
services and facility management, with the aim of improving operational management and
transparency towards customers.

The developed application allows employees to record their attendance at clients using tech-
nologies such as QR codes, as well as to report anomalies and order necessary equipment.
Supervisors can verify attendance records and report any issues related to service quality,
while customers have the opportunity to provide feedback and report any problems encoun-
tered.

To ensure a smooth and secure user experience, the application integrates advanced tech-
nologies such as communication via REST APIs between frontend and backend, secure
user credential management via JWT tokens, and direct interaction with mobile device hard-
ware components to collect GPS data and scan QR codes. The application also offers an
intuitive interface that simplifies the required operations and ensures quick and secure ac-
cess to the main features.

The design and development of the system required the integration of various software
components, including a backend based on Node.js and Express, a frontend developed
with React, and the use of a MySQL relational database managed through the Sequelize
ORM. This allowed the creation of a scalable and modular system capable of meeting the
management and quality control needs of Progect SA.
